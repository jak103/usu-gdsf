# Front end testing info

* We are using the jest testing framework with the vue/test-utils to mount a component
* To create a test just have the file extention be `<filename>.test.spec`
* Use the command `npm test` to run the tests.
* To test elements of a component the data-test attribute will need to be added to find the element eg. `data-test="listItem1`
*
